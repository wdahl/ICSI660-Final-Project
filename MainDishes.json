I only used an 1/8 teaspoon of black pepper as some of the family have sensitive stomachs. I added perhaps one or two tablespoons of water so there would be enough moisture to create steam to poach the fish when the lid was placed on the pan. I'll be making this again and again! UPDATE: I made this for a second time poaching as before. This time I sprinkled the dry spices over the salmon and drizzled a bit of maple on each filet. I skipped the oil entirely and everyone liked it even better than last time. It's my new \"impress the company\" recipe!",

              "reviewBody": "OMG this was soooo good. Leftovers were good too. I made some changes only because I bought a 3.8 pound top pork loin on sale for 8 instead of the 1.9 pound pork tenderloin for 16. So I had to go to my good old Betty Crocker cookbook and to the internet to get cooking times. Did all of the ingredients the same except left off garlic and doubled all the ingredients and increased apple cider to 2 cups. I did the rub ahead of time because I was home anyway and let it sit under a blanket of plastic rap for 4 hours before cooking. Betty Crocker said to cook Top Pork Loin at 325 for 30-40 mins per pound to get internal temp of 170. I cooked it for a total of about 2 hours at 350 with just the cider mix (no sweets or apples). Also had to look up Sweet Potatos = 350 degrees for about an hour. So added them after Pork loin cooked for one hour. And I looked up Apples = 350 for about 15 minutes (I did smaller slices - like 8/apple). Even though I did over cook it a smidge when I made the first cut liquid squirted out and I knew it would be juicy and tender which it was. For leftovers we put potoatoes/apples/juice in sauce pan on low. And my husband dabbed some of the juice on the pork slices and put brown sugar/ginger mix on each side. He cooked them separately in the oven on stoneware plate at 350 for about 7 minutes then broiled at 500 until a little bubbly - a couple minutes.",

Raw chicken on the bone should take no more than 45 minutes - 1 hour to cook while braising.  2 - 3 hours is way too much, and it calls for the chicken to be browned first.  I give every new recipe the benefit of the doubt, and I followed the instructions.  I went with 2 hours.  As I expected, the chicken was basically mush by the end.  The picture that accompanies this recipe is 100% misleading.  And 3 cups of water?  Way too much.  This came out like chicken soup.  It would have been WAYYY richer and superior texture-wise to cook the shallots and make a masala with the spices.  Then add only coconut milk (no water at all) and let that simmer for 10 minutes.   Brown the chicken separately and then add it into the coconut milk mixture to simmer for 10 - 15 minutes.  This wasted about 4 hours of my time and some of my $.",

I’m not on keto but just a wanted something tasty and healthy. I usually don’t like cauliflower but the cauliflower rice was well incorporated and didn’t bother me at all. The only thing is that I would like to find a way to make the sauce of the mixture just a little bit thicker next time (maybe slightly less water or a little bit of some kind of thickener? Or let it simmer a bit longer?). Sorry my picture isn’t great, the red plates we have don’t make food the most photogenic. Anyway it was delicious and I’d definitely make it again even if I can’t thicken it.\n\nUpdate: I had extra mixture when making this recently (I bought the peppers a couple days ahead and one went bad so I could only make two rather than four) and I just added some of it to some leftover spaghetti. Delicious!",

I was most impressed by the crunchiness of the batter! I have a go-to Chic-Fil-A copycat recipe that possibly has a slightly better flavor due to the addition of a TB of powdered sugar in the dry batter but it does not achieve the crust that you'll get with this recipe. I really liked the flavor! I definitely recommend marinating your chicken overnight or as long as you can before cooking.",

I highly recommend you only use one chicken breast to make two sandwiches. If you prefer the bun a Chick-fil-A sandwich comes on, you really need to use brioche buns and be sure to toast it before assembling your sandwich. Do not be afraid to add the cayenne pepper to your breading. it doesn’t really add any heat, just flavor. I also added hot sauce to mayo. At 40 years old, this is the first fried chicken I have ever successfully made. It is super easy if you follow the recipe. Good luck and Enjoy!!",

I followed the entire recipe to a T as far as the marinade, wash and breading but made chicken tenders instead of sandwiches using breast tenderloin filets.  We all loved it!!  I cut back a tad on the cayenne pepper so probably only used about 1 tsp and I made my own buttermilk using the milk combined with lemon juice.  The chicken was super moist and the breading extremely flavorful-it didn't even need salt or pepper afterwards.  I served the chicken fingers will ranch, honey mustard and BBQ dipping sauces.  My BF (who's not a huge fan of chicken) said multiple times during dinner \"this chicken is REALLY good\" and even mentioned it twice the following day so I'm taking that as a good sign:). These will most definitely be made again!\nThe only issue I had was the chicken stuck to the wire deep fry basket and lost some coating when I tried to use tongs to get them out.  We switched to a spatula on the last batch which was more efficient altho that's a user failure!",

              "reviewBody": "This was just OK for us. Have to be honest, we didn’t care for the strong flavor of paprika. Don’t know why this is called “Sicilian” roasted chicken because paprika is not a spice that is really used in Sicily or any part of Italy for that matter. More like “Hungarian” chicken. I make a similar dish to this without the paprika, but add granulated garlic, onion powder, dried oregano & rosemary, or some already mixed dried Italian seasoning. First step is to  dry the chicken pieces off with paper towels before adding seasonings so it browns up nicely and has a crispy skin. If using all breasts, give them a light brushing with olive oil first. This helps to keep the meat moister.  Then just lay it out on a sheet pan and roast for about 35-45 min at  400°, depending on what kind of oven you have. Mine is convection so takes less time. Easy and delicious.",

I added 1/2 cup finely chopped red bell pepper, 10 shakes of Worcesteshire, more garlic, seasoning salt, splash of light soy, dried parsley, a whole egg not just the white. (For those that say your patties fall apart..I have a trick...You add the yolk of the egg as it helps to hold the mix together even when you have them flat as possible. Also put a light coating of flour on the patties just before you cook them ensuring that you shake off the excess flour. The flour helps form a light, crusty exterior and holds the patty and makes it easier to flip.) The egg yolk and extra bell pepper meant I had to add more breadcrumbs and for those who say their mix is sticky, you should probably add more crumbs anyway. How well they hold together in you hand is how well they hold on the pan. Juicy and very tasty.",

I found this recipe to be really good with the following additions: 1)  added a few drops of hickory seasoning liquid smoke  2)  add a few drops of Worcestershire sauce, 3) add a small, plastic package of soy sauce, leftover from a Chinese restaurant. This will guarantee that these babies will taste like beef.  I tried this on my equally carnivorous roomie, who proclaimed that due to my dilgent efforts, some can be fooled into thinking they're eating a Quarter Pounder, no cheese, extra onion.  Speaking of onion, shred fine with a shredder.  I used parsley from my garden.  Good going, Trudi!",

              "reviewBody": "These burgers were scrumptious! I'd take them any day over regular hamburgers! (The husband, who's a big turkey fan, adored them too). When I made them, I substituted onion powder for chopped onion, left out the garlic, and added a few tablespoons of soy sauce, a couple teaspoons of worchestershire, and a few shakes of hot sauce. I also used Lawry's seasoning salt instead of regular salt. And I used italian-style bread crumbs. I put these on the grill, and sprinkled a little garlic powder and a little more worchestershire sauce on them as they cooked. I served them topped with lettuce, red onion, ketchup, and mustard, and they were so flavorful and juicy! Some other users said they added mushrooms to keep the burgers from being dry, but i found that the worchestershire will do the job just fine, and adds better flavor!",

The second time (after taking the advice of other users) I added a splash of liquid smoke, a splash of worcestershire sauce, and a splash of soy sauce. This recipe was a little tastier. The third time was definitely the best....instead of 1/4 cup of bread crumbs, I used 3/4 cup of Italian bread crumbs. I used one whole egg instead of two egg whites. I omitted the teaspoon of salt and added 2 Tablespoons of soy sauce instead. I added the splash of liquid smoke and worcestershire. Instead of trying to peel and mince the clove of garlic, I added 1 teaspoon of minced garlic out of the jar. The rest of the recipe (onion, parsley, pepper) I kept the same. Finally...I tried to pan fry the first two times, but grilled them on the BBQ the third time....10X better flavor! The one thing I learned is that you MUST spray the hell out of the grill with Pam to keep the patties from sticking.",

I combined some tomato sauce, brown sugar, salt and worcestshire sauce and poured it over the loaf in the pan before baking it.  It was great.  I would highly recommend this recipe to someone who may have tried turkey for burgers, but were turned off by the bland texture and taste.  This recipe overcomes all those issues, and is lowfat and healthful, too.  Thanks for the recipe.",

I dipped the boneless, skinless chicken breasts into the butter and then into the crumbs. I baked at the recommended temp for 50 minutes then checked the internal temp. 160F!! Pulled them out and...

I prefer it marinated all day with the rootbeer and a tablespoon of worchestershire, heavily salted/peppered prior to grilling.  2 teaspoons chipotle sauce and I also use Campbells 2x strength beef broth to start for this.  The reduction down to 3/4 cup is approximate (I tend not to measure things-rather go by taste), it should be pretty potent and salty sweet.  Remember, you have to taste everything and make sure to adjust seasoning to your families tastes.",

EDIT- I thought I should add I let the chops marinate for 6 hours because that is the amount of time I had.  Defintely will do it for longer next time.  Also, I used a charcoal grill, which lends a nice flavor in my opinion.  In addition, my pepper mill is filled with a combo of black, white and red pepper corns, which is a wonderful combo that adds another flavor dynamic.  Finally, I used habanero hot sauce (Big Ben's BBQ brand- which I highly recommend), instead of chipotle flavored.  Very tasty.  A tip of my hat to you Ken!",

So....what I did was combine all the ingredients (with a couple tablespoons of cornstarch wisked in), braised my pork chops and stuck everything in the crockpot. Only change I made was adding in some sliced onions and minced garlic that I sauteed in the pan that I braised the pork chops in. I didn't need the extra salt as my beef broth and the worchestershire was salty enough on it's own. This made for some very tasty and moist pork chops but it needs a little something else. I can't put my finger on it. Maybe a tablespoon of dijon? A bay leaf? I liked the combination of the root beer and beef broth, it was sweet and beefy all at the same time.....it's just missing just a little somethin'-somethin'. This went really well with mashed potatoes. NOTE: I also used Campbell's beef broth only because it's double strength and has a stronger flavor than your usual boxed broth. I used a quality root beer, too. I think that makes all the difference.",

First of all as written while still producing a tender finished dish I give it a 4 for the fact that even beyond \"personal taste\" I think this would be a bit bland but with SO much potential. That said it turns into an easy 5 star with Ken's changes which he states in his review. So I added more chipotle hot sauce a fair bit of black pepper more Worcestershire sauce and I did marinate the chops in all of those ingredients not just the root beer. Followed the rest of the recipe as stated. We used Barq's root beer because we much prefer the \"bite\" to it as opposed to a sweeter one. I would do it all the same next time other than omitting the brown sugar but again that's only a personal taste in not liking things as sweet as some do. That does NOT lower my rating.:) Thank you Ken for the addition and the clarifying review.:)",

I followed the recipe exactly - marinating in the root beer and then using fresh root beer to combine with the other ingredients and reducing the liquid down to 3/4 cup and using it as a 'glaze' while grilling.  The end result was -- ok.  The chops were a little on the sweet side - but that's really all there was.  It seemed like a lot of effort for only an 'ok' end result.  For us, they were average - not bad - but not particularly special. **8/23/2010 update - I used the leftovers from this in the Pork Salad Croissant recipe from this site.  The leftovers worked GREAT in this salad.  The sweetness of the root beer was a nice complement to the spice of the chutney in the recipe and worked well with the apple and grape.",

We all ate it and enjoyed it. My dad said it took more work than he usually likes to put into cooking supper, but I consider that a good thing - much better than a bottled sauce or marinade. Thanks for the great recipe Ken.",
