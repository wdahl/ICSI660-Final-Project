The fresher it is, the better this works, so I do this as soon as I get home from the store (also makes weeknight cooking quicker & easier when I am ready to make).  I also like to line the baking sheet with aluminum foil for easy clean up.  Instead of tossing with olive oil I spray with cooking spray after the asparagus is spread in an even layer on the sheet.  I promise it tastes just as good.  Then I sprinkle with coarse salt & fine pepper (sprinkle from up high to more evenly distribute the seasonings).",

I worked 10 years as a baker and the recipe we used at the bake shop was similar except this recipe didn't call for any cream of tartar, so I added it to my version. I added 1/2 tspn. What it does is make the cookie crack better when baking which gives it a better appeal in appearance as appose to that smooth top looking cookie which I don't like. It doesn't do anything for flavor so if you don't care about whether its smooth or cracked then don't bother with the suggestion.",

For added flavor I also add l cup of white chocolate chips (try the brand that Aldi's carries...wonderful....better then Nestles!!) Some have stated that their cookies were too cakelike, this is caused by the addition of too much flour.  To help prevent this, spoon flour into measuring cup, leveling off with knife, rather then dipping cup into flour. Roll dough into walnut size balls.  Be careful not to overbake, I decrease my oven temperature to 325 and bake for l0 minutes.  I have tried dozens of chocolate chip cookie recipes over the years, this one is far superior to any of them!! Makes 4 dozen. Thanks for sharing.",

I was baking in our second home today, where I have a convection oven (which I remain somewhat unfamiliar with). I don't know if it was the convection oven or something else I'm missing, but these did not turn out to be fairly standard chocolate chip cookies! Rather, they were some of the best I've ever tried. First of all, they stay uniform in shape and size, which is important to me, and they're just the right thickness--not poofy little cakes, and not flat and spread out. They're rich and buttery, with crispy outsides, and a soft but chewey inside. I didn't bother to mix the baking soda in the 2 tsp. hot water, just mixed it in with the flour--I also added 1/2 tsp. salt to heighten flavor. Since 2 tsp. of water was called for that I didn't use, I \"upped\" the vanilla to a full tablespoon. I also used milk chocolate chips this time around, but that surely can't account for why these were so darn good and so pretty either. I'm so proud of how these turned out and I'll be proud to send them with my husband tomorrow to his meeting. If not \"Best Chocolate Chip Cookies,\" this recipe is certainly ONE of the best!",

I also recommend using Trader Joe's Vanilla Paste, but that's just a preference. However, if you want the perfect cookie, be sure to chill your dough for at least an hour (2 hours is better) and they will come out even. I baked at 325 for about 12 minutes. On Silpat or parchment paper, they'll turn out fabulous every time. I am sending them to work with my fiance to keep me from eating three dozen of them! :)",

              "reviewBody": "THESE COOKIES ARE LIFE-CHANGING. The best I've ever tasted in 25 years of baking.  They have the right balance of flavor and texture. HERE'S A FEW TIPS TO GUARANTEE PERFECTION:  1.  Replace 1 to 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour with oatmeal flour (oatmeal that's been processed until powder).  2.  Take cookies out of the oven before they appear fully cooked, and let them stay on the cookie sheet for at least ten minutes.  Cookies allowed to cool on the cookie sheet are much chewier.  3.  I find dissolving the baking soda in water is unneccesary, they come out perfect regardless though I still added the spoon of hot water.  4.  Use salted butter in this recipe in addition to the salt called for. 5. This dough freezes well.  I double it, roll half into one-inch balls then freeze so I can have ready made cookie dough balls to bake another time.   ",

They weren't too cake-like and they weren't thin and greasy, they were the perfect in-between cookie.  That said, the dough is very thick once you mix all the ingredients together.  A bit of advice - if you like a thinner cookie and not so cake-like, make a smaller ball of dough and when you place it on the cookie sheet be sure to flatten it quite a bit as the dough doesn't seem to spread when in the oven.  If you like thick cookies, just leave them in the ball and they'll stay big.  As the recipe states, they are crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside - still nice and moist the following day.  I added some Skor toffee bits to the recipe and they turned out amazing - will definitely make again!!  Thanks for sharing.",

It cooks down and is sooo aromatic.  The mix of sausage and beef is sublime, so no need for more salt.  I always add a dash of nutmeg to the ricotta mixture (an old italian secret!).  I usually make this a day ahead for the flavors and herbs to meld in the fridge then let it sit at room temperature for about 1 hour before baking. Have made for company too, and always get RAVES on it's authenticity.  Great, winter comfort food and feeds a lot of people.  Another tip for lasagna makers - no need to wash another pot to boil noodles.  Soak raw, hard noodles in a large bowl of very hot tap water for 20-30 min.  Noodles won't be cooked but soft, and can complete it's cooking in the oven.  I learned this from a caterer - try it!",

              "reviewBody": "I made this recipe using some tips and tricks from previous reviewers and from my experience having worked in an italian restaurant.  This recipe does not have to be as time intensive as is recommended in the instructions.  As another reviewer noted, it is not necessary to cook the noodles--just soak them in hot water while you are cooking the rest of the ingredients.  You also do not need to cook the sauce.  Sounds bizarre, but it's true.  If you make the lasagna ahead and leave it in the fridge overnight, the flavors blend perfectly, no cooking required.  For a chunkier tomato sauce, I subbed 1/2 of the crushed tomatoes with diced italian-flavored tomatoes.  I layered everything in this order: sauce-noodles-ricotta mixture-sauce-meat-shredded mozzerella...i did 3 layers like this and then finished with a layer of noodles, sauce and shredded mozzerella and a generous sprinkling of parmesean on top.  Following this method, I had the whole thing put together and in the fridge in less than an hour.  It sat overnight and my husband had it in the oven when I got home from work.  Fantastic recipe!",

From reading all the reviews, I made these changes: Added an additional 1/2 pound of ground meat, omitted the salt, doubled the onions, all the spices, the parsley, canned tomatoes, paste, and sauce. I also doubled the filling ingredients and made three layers instead of two. Everyone raved about the lasagna and I have sauce left over for another use. \r\nSIDE NOTE: For anyone who thinks they don't like ricotta cheese: Buy it at an Italian market. Brands such as Sierra or Polly-O. There is no comparison to the taste or texture of supermarket brands. I think that's why I see recipes with regular cottage cheese instead of riccota. I don't use supermarket riccota under any circumstances, it's just plain nasty!",

I make it pretty much as shown, except if I have the time, I let the sauce simmer on the stove as long as possible. I also add a bit of whatever red wine I have on hand to the sauce. And I try to make a double recipe, so I can use the sauce for other things - it works wonderfully for Chicken Parmesan, plain ol' spaghetti, and anywhere else you'd use a red sauce.\r\n\r\nEverything tastes better the second day, too. Oh, one more thing - I never boil my noodles. I simply buy regular dried noodles, and make sure I have plenty of sauce in the lasagna. It cooks long enough that the noodles boil in the oven, and you end up with a lasagna that isn't runny and holds its shape well.",

LEAN gr. beef tripled the garlic reduced sugar to 1 T. reduced salt to 1 t. used 9 lasagna noodles per pan and used 1 pound mozzarella (shredded) cheese per pan. I read the reviews about omitting the fennel and I have to disagree. I believe the fennel is one of the ingredients that makes this dish outstanding. I made the sauce the day before and simmered for 6 hours. Sounds like a lot of work but come on! How hard is it to check a pot simmering??! I had enough sauce for 2 pans of lasagna so that's what I did. Made 2 baked one and froze the other. I just finally made my frozen one yesterday. I allowed it to thaw in the fridge overnight and then baked as directed. Just as delicious as the first batch!!! My hubby is a lasagna snob and says this is the best lasagna recipe ever.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I only used 1/3 of the salt called for. (One serving of the original recipe is almost a full daily allowance of sodium.) It was still too salty. It tasted like something you'd buy in the freezer section at the grocery store. Why waste all that time making it at home if it doesn't taste any better than the manufactured stuff and isn't any healthier? There also seemed to be too much sauce and not enough of the ricotta mixture or mozzarella. Suggestions: 1. Leave out the added salt altogether. There's already enough salt in the sausage, parmesan and canned tomato products to season everything. 2. Drain the meat after browning and before adding anything else. All that saturated fat does nothing to improve the flavor. 3. Use oregano instead of Italian seasoning and leave out the fennel. Italian sausage already has fennel in it. 4. Leave out one of the cans of tomato paste. The condensed tomato flavor was so strong it drowned out the spices. 5. Use a full 16-oz block of mozzarella, and grate it instead of slicing it. You'll get more even coverage. 6. Double the ricotta mixture (ricotta, egg, parsley). 7. (Optional) Replace the 1/2 cup of water with 1/2 cup of red wine, preferably chianti or cabernet sauvignon.",

I made a few changes to this recipe based on past reviews and am glad I did ... here are my suggestons ... use fresh whole wheat lasagna noodles (found in the deli dept.) ... no need to cook them and they come in sheets ... make 3 layers for lasagna dish ... therefore, you would require 8 fresh lasagna sheets ... I had to read through a lot of reviews to figure out what to do with the italian sausage, as it doesn't explan in the recipe how to cook that ... what you do is buy mild italian sausages (couldn't find sweet italian sausage and I understand through most reviews that most people can't) ... you then remove the casing around the sausage, remove the meat and fry the meat until cooked in a frying pan ... instead of using 1 tbsp. salt in the sauce, I used 1 tsp. ... and it was perfect ... I suggest going with your taste ... same thing with the sugar ... go with your personal taste ... the layers were a little difficult to figure out so here is what works ... make 3 layers ... first layer is meat sauce, noodles, mozzarella cheese, and parmesan cheese ... 2nd layer is meat sauce, noodles, ricotta cheese mixture (add a little nutmeg for taste), parmesan cheese ... 3rd layer is meat sauce, noodles, mozzarella cheese, and parmesan cheese ... defiitely add the fennel seeds ... gives great f",

(Have you EVER heard of a recipe that calls for a full tablespoon?) Between the cheeses and the canned tomato products, no additional salt was needed. This recipe would easily be a base for your favorite additions: spinach, mushrooms, zucchini, etc. Other reviewers were absolutely correct: plan to make this the day before serving. It makes all the difference in the blending of flavors and incredible taste. I served this with homemade cheese bread and a crisp green salad.",

              "reviewBody": "I am giving this 5 stars b/c all of my friends liked it and asked me for the recipe!  I made this for my women's group holiday dinner.  I would personally give it 4 stars.  It was a bit too meaty for me and there didn't seem to be enough ricotta (but I know a lot of peopele don't like ricotta anyways).  I followed a couple reviewer's suggestions and soaked the noodles in a large roasting pan (try it -there is plenty of room to allow the noodles to lay flat) in VERY hot tap water for about 30 minutes. I added the browned meat / garlic / onion mixture to the tomatoes, paste, sauce, seasonings, etc. WITHOUT simmering.  I assembled the lasagna the evening before (sauce, 6 noodles, ricotta, mozzarella slices, sauce, Parmesan, exact same layer again and sprinkled with shredded mozzarella and rest of Parm).  I purchased a 1 lb. package of sliced mozzarella and ended up using all of it (and it turned out fine).  Also purchased mild Italian sausage (not the sweet stuff - couldn't find it).  Be sure to use fresh parsley.  It gives the dish nice color and adds a fresh taste that you won't get from the dried stuff.  Also, be sure to add fennel seed.  It really adds  nice flavor to the dish.  Leftovers were yummy.  I took some to my parents, and my mom had one square.  My dad ate the other 4!  This one's a keeper, and is worthy of all stars because of the compliments - and shortcuts.  Try them, they REALLY, REALLY work!.  Thanks!",

I didn't tell anyone of the change (I cook for a family of 10) and got lots of excellent compliments. I did receive one complaint about the dish I made, but it came from from a very picky young man who thinks that Taco Bell is authentic Mexican food. :-)  After the first time I used this recipe, I made up a large batch of seasoning to have on hand. It was so easy since I had all of the spices in my pantry anyway. I found that 2 *very* heaping tablespoons of the seasoning equals about one regular seasoning packet. My family likes things a little spicy though, so two regular tablespoons would probably be sufficient.",

I added 1 tsp of cornstarch (or 2 tsp of flour will work) to the mix which allows the spices to cling more readily to the meat as a thickened sauce. The spice mixture is great, but sometime was missing.  I looked around at a few other recipes and found one mentioning a beef bullion cube.  I have Better than Bullion paste (beef or chicken) and add a tsp while cooking the beef.  What a difference! It really gives  the meaty flavor that was lacking (hard to believe more meatiness is needed in a pound of ground beef, but it's true).  Whichever recipe you use, try adding some meat stock paste or equivalent (but do consider the added salt from bullion if you like it not too salty).  Also this recipe doesn't mention it, but adding a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water towards the end after browning the meat with the seasoning allows the flavor to really mingle and absorb as you heat and reduce the sauce down a bit (that's where the cornstatch cling really shines). The water addition is just the basic instruction from the old packets I used to buy and it's not a step I'd ever skip.",

Frantic, I ran to the computer and found this! YEAH!! I mixed it in with some cream cheese and sour cream to taste it first and it was great.  Worked even better in the dip!! If I'd had known how easy this was, I would have been making my own taco seasoning for a while now!! The only thing I changed was reduced the chili powder to 1/2 TBLS.  Very good and will make again!! Thanks Bill for posting this!",

I followed recipe except slightly decreased amt of red pepper flakes and omitted onion powder (didn't have any).  I cooked 1 & 1/4 lb. low fat ground beef with fresh garlic; poured off fat.  Added Taco seasoning + 1/2 c. fresh, chopped onions + 1 cup water. Brought to boil and simmered for about 15 min.  Next time I would decrease water to 2/3 or 3/4 cup (I had a little too much liquid, but not a problem).  Very good.  DH loved these tacos!",

There are a few tips that will ensure your brownies are not cakey. I do not use a mixer because you can overmix your batter and whip too much air into the eggs. This makes your brownies have a cakey texture. Mix everything by hand in a bowl and lightly beat your eggs before adding them to the mixture. Gently stirring everything together makes them turn out better as opposed to franticly beating the mixture. Hope this helps, because I will NEVER buy brownie mix again.",

The problem with the frosting is that you need to halve the amount of powdered sugar and melt the butter.  This makes a glaze that you can spread on top.  It hardens into a beautiful, shiny frosting.  I thought some of the info in the reviews was conflicting, so here's the scoop:  1.  These are neither \"cake\" brownies nor \"fudge\" brownies; they fall somewhere in between.  If you must have one or the other, then this recipe is not for you.  2.  Yes, the frosting is sweet.  If you like frosting, then add it, if not, leave it off.  3.  Yes, these are homemade brownies and do not taste like boxed brownie mix.  I can't understand why anyone would prefer a mix to homemade, but if that's your thing, then stick with the mix.",

              "reviewBody": "Wonderful little brownie! Not too thick, not too thin, just right! Comes together and into the oven in less than 5 minutes. I added about 1 additional T. of cocoa. Just mix all ingredients with a wooden spoon in the same pan as you melted the butter, about 50 strokes, just until good and combined. The frosting is glossy and smooth if you melt the butter first and add about 1 T. each of corn syrup and half and half. Cutting these with a plastic knife, even the disposable tableware variety, works great!  Cuts cleanly, and not a crumb sticks to the knife. Had to try 3 of the brownies as soon as they were cooled, just to be triply sure they were good.",

No need to beat with mixer.  A wooden spoon to mix the batter until everything is wet works just fine.\nI used the frosting recipe which was very fudge-like and thick. I added just a smidgen of water to thin it out to make it at least somewhat spreadable.",

Mama Cass hit the nail on the head saying this was neither a \"fudgy\" brownie nor a \"cake-like\" brownie, but both - that's what made it so awesome.  I didn't have the honey for the frosting so frosted it with the best chocolate frosting IMO - boil 3TB butter, 1/3 c sugar, 2TB milk for a minute, remove from heat and add 1/3 c chocolate chips.  Yummmm!  Doubt anyone will read this after 1,000 some reviews, but just realized this recipe is similar to one a use for waffle cookies - only I melt the butter and cocoa powder in the microwave together and it mixes together much easier.  Just a thought.",

Mix all but Parm in bowl, slather over chicken, then sprinkle Parm LIBERALLY over all.  Ensure the mayo mixture is thick on the chicken.  Cook in 350 oven for 1 hr 10 min.

I have been trying buttercream recipes for 4 months now, and it's been horrible. I wanted something that did not include the nasty shortening, and was easy to make. I didn't have any luck with any meringue buttercreams either, which just tasted like a big block of butter and requires refrigeration, re-whipping, etc. I was THRILLED to find this recipe! First I made the initial recipe as written, which was a small batch. Then I quadrupled the recipe to make 32 servings to frost/decorate a 9 x 13 layer cake. I found that it's EXTREMELY important to cream the softened butter for several minutes first, then I added the confectioners sugar (after sifting it first) a cup at a time until combined. Then added clear vanilla extract, and for the 4x recipe I only used 1 Tbsp skim milk. Then really important: continue to beat for another 4 minutes! Came out SO fluffy and light and snow white colored. Extremely easy to frost and pipe decorations. Got a nice crust as well. I had several \"foodies\" taste it and they gave it 2 thumbs up as well.

I needed to add almost 2/3 cup more powdered sugar to make it stiff enough to pipe on. To decorate a 9x13\" cake, you will want to double the recipe.  (Make sure you use clear vanilla if you want white icing.)",

My husband and I made this sauce (served over fettuccine noodles) for my friend and her husband, as they just had their third child a few days ago and we figured they could use the break from cooking - they went nuts, they loved it so much!  Even their two younger sons (3 and 2) loved this dish.  It literally tastes IDENTICAL to the sauce that they serve at the Olive Garden.  Another good tip is to add a can of drained mushrooms to the sauce - it really tastes great.  I'd give this 6 stars if I could - I will NEVER buy alfredo sauce again!  The next time I might use milk and a little cornstarch instead of the cream (as one previous reviewer suggested) and perhaps reduced fat margarine to save on fat and calories.  Be sure to use fresh shredded parmesan (available in bags in the dairy section), Kraft grated just doesn't do it as well - and the shredded parm melts really well.  ENJOY this incredible dish!

The consistency is a little hard to get smooth, but probably because parmesan is a very hard cheese with a granular texture to begin with, and doesn't melt smoothly. I used a parmesan/asiago blend and it was beautifully smooth after lots of whisking. Also, make sure you use unsalted butter - if you use margarine or lightly salted butter, it's way too salty. I used this recipe to make a white chicken lasagna, which was absolutely delicious, and it held up well in the refrigerator to have leftovers the next day.",

I made a double recipe, added 1.5 pounds of pan seared chicken breast and poured it over tri-color rotini (it was the only pasta in the house). Unbelievable! It was a little thin at first, but thickened as it cooled. I used genuine Parmesan Reggiano and it melted wonderfully smooth--just be sure to add only a handful at a time. Do not boil, or the sauce will separate.",

My husband was none too pleased, and my children were less than enthused which is a far cry from their usual elation with my Italian cooking. I made this for my family yesterday, and recognized the taste right away as being a recipe I've made before though not from this site (copy cat recipes; the book actually). I added 1/8 tsp ground pepper since the flavor was sadly lacking. While I know that I'm am a tough critic having lived for 3 years in Italy this wasn't even passable to my husband who has only visited there with me. This alfredo is fine for someone with a bland palate, but if it's flavor you crave then move on to a recipe more original and authentic.",

The high heat will cause the cheese to turn grainy... a slow simmer will keep it smooth and creamy.\nNote: A simmer is where the temperature of the liquid is just below the boiling point, or where small bubbles come to the surface and break gently.\nYou could try different cheeses... why not, or you could substitute the parsley with another herb, such as, Cilantro.\n\nOh, and I enjoy a bit more garlic... keeps the Vampires away.",

              "reviewBody": "I'll be honest I really just wanted this recipe for the dough because my grandma told me how to make her cinnamon buns (which were the best in the world). sadly though she never gave me the dough recipe before she died and ever since i've been trying to replicate it.  The best compliment i can give you is when I ate these buns I felt like i was getting a hug from my grandma. I used a spice cake mix instead of vanilla and they turned out sweet and soft and delicious and they were so easy to make.  Thank you for giving me that moment.  I can't wait to make them for my grandpa.  If you want to try them grams way  spread the butter on and add the brown sugar and cinnamon generously.  roll them up and cut like normal.  Place them in a 9x13 baking dish and top each bun with a little more cinnamon and brown sugar then pour enough corn syrup just to cover the tops of each bun.bake according to this recipe.  This makes a delicious sticky bun.",

I also added about 1 tsp of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon as others have recommended. I followed another users recommendation to seperate the whites from the eggs (beated until fluffy) and folded them into the batter as the final step--turned out nice and fluffy. I served these plain with the cinnamon butter recipe. Also, you can freeze left-overs (if any) in plastic baggies to be taken out at a later time to be quickly reheated in the toaster. 5-star plus--thanks for the wonderful recipe!",

If you have a spare minute beat the egg whites separate, then fold them in at the last, not vital but you will not regret it.\r\n\r\nI also doubled the vanilla and sugar, but the waffles seemed a bit bland still, relying on butter/syrup to bring most of the flavor. A good active-yeast recipe will taste better, but are generally more dense.\r\n\r\nAlso be sure to USE BAKING POWDER, NOT SODA, then the 4 teaspoons called for is perfect, if you put in 4 tsp of soda you'll never have heartburn again...\r\n\r\nBottom line, these waffles are well worth making. Simple, light and almost 5 star good.",

              "reviewBody": "This is a great, basic, easy waffle.  My waffle iron sat unused for--literally--10 years.  Wanted to try something new this morning with basic ingredients that I knew I had in the kitchen.  \r\n\r\nThe first waffle didn't turn out because I didn't use enough batter--my waffle iron needed about 2/3 cup each--but after that they were perfect.\r\n\r\nFor those new to waffle-making, here is a good tip I have used to know when they are done without having to open the iron constantly to look (which can ruin the waffle if it is still soft)...  It's done when the waffle quits ejecting plumes of steam around the edges of the iron.  (It's also usually done when it quits sticking to the iron.)\r\n\r\nWill definitely make these again -- probably tomorrow!",

              "reviewBody": "HALF THE CALORIES, NO BRAINER!!  These waffles are good BUT...I made easy changes to make HUGE improvements to the nutritional value.  Instead of 2 eggs I used 3 egg whites and I used skim milk made into buttermilk instead of 2% milk (just add 1-1/2T lemon juice and let sit for 5 minutes). In place of ½ cup of oil I used fat-free vanilla yogurt.  I agree with other reviews that the recipe as written is a little bland so instead of 1 tbsp white sugar I used ¼ cup Splenda.  I also used 2 tsp of vanilla and about a heaping tsp cinnamon.  I can feel GOOD about serving a 195 calorie waffle as opposed to a 400 calorie waffle - especially when my picky husband can't tell the difference!",

However, with a few modifications it melts in your mouth!  \nHere are the modifications that I made and yes, this will be redundant because so many other reviewers have done the same thing, AND with good reason!  Yum Yum!\nSugar changed 2 tablespoon brown sugar AND 2 tablespoon white sugar\nvanilla extract changed 1 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract\nAdded 1/4 tsp of cinnamon did not want to overpower the flavor of the waffles themselves.  \nThe other changes I did were on the building...\nThe eggs and how they are incorporated.. and yes, again this is redundant because sooo many others have said the same thing and it works to make them light and delicious!\nseperate the eggs... put the whites in the blender and whip them till they start forming the fluffy whites... then add the yolks on low... then i added the milk, then the vegetable oil allowing to mix before adding the vanilla and all the dry goods (mix them before hand in another bowl).  \nThis helped produce a light waffle that really melted in my mouth YUM!  I will post a pict later of how they turned out.",

Definitely use low salt Soup.  The chicken was really tender.  I’ll make this again.",

I used double of the mushrooms, came out great. I also used cream of mushroom instead. Great recipe and really good flavor, this is definitely a keeper for future dinners. I think this would be a great dinner if you were having guest over a nice dinner.",

My husband would give it 5 stars.  I give it 4 for taste.  Unfortunately I will NOT make this recipe again as it is just very labor intensive.  Lots of ingredients being cooked on the stove first, then transferrend to the baking dish while it awaits the next layer of ingredients to cook on the stove, and then again.   Make sure you have enough time to prep!",

It is a dense cake, so if you are looking for light and fluffy, keep looking.  But If you are looking for really good 'wedding cake' type of cake... here it is! \nI put on the \"Buttercream icing\" from LISKAGIRL on this site and it was really good combo!!  One person said the cake with the frosting tasted almost like a really good sugar cookie!  But it was not overpowering sweet.\nI followed other reviewers and added an extra 1/4 cup of milk.  I also beat the heck out of every step.  MAKE SURE you beat the sugar and the butter for 8-10 minutes!!  BUT IT IS SOOOOO WORTH IT!!  I couldn't keep away from it!",

              "reviewBody": "This recipe actually deserves 4 1/2 stars.  I made it twice in the same night.  The first batch was perfect!  5 stars all the way.  The batter was rather fluffy.  I made it the second time around (I don't think I let the eggs  beat as long) The batter was a lot thinner (although both times I added about 1/4 cup of extra milk).  After baking, The first batch was fantastic!  Great cake, easy to frost.  The second time around, however, deserves about 3 stars.  As others have said, it had a cornbread type element to it.  It was bad, but it was incredibly hard to frost.  I made 9x13, 8x11, 9x9, and 4x9 of this cake and it cooked well and evenly in every pan. All I can say is, pay very close attention to the directions, sift your ingredients, and let your eggs beat awhile.  If your batter looks somewhat like yellowish coolwhip, you're gonna have a great cake :)",

I think this recipe is great with following changes: 1-2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp salt, increase milk to 3/4 cup and use buttermilk if you have it. Also if you want a lighter texture you really need to use cake flour, if you don't have any make you own by replacing 2 tbsp of cornstarch in 1 cup of all purpose.",

              "reviewBody": "I've long ago learned to be skeptical of the results with white cake recipes. They can be dry, tasteless, or have what some call a similarity to cornbread.  I wanted a white cake that was moist, sweet and flavorful, without having to resort to a pound cake recipe, which would be heavier.  I wanted a light, fluffy cake with a tender crumb.  Butter isn't going to necessarily get you that, nor is a shortage of eggs or sugar.  In this recipe I was tempted to reduce the amount of flour, and increase the amount of sugar and eggs but decided to leave it alone, especially for the sake of properly accessing this recipe - except for one small change, which probably was an important one. I used half butter for flavor and richness, and half shortening, to help ensure moistness.  Cream the shortening and butter very well with the sugar, a good few minutes, add each egg separately and beat  well after each addition.  I added the WHOLE milk alternately with the flour mixture, beginning and ending with the flour, and mixing lightly, only enough to combine the ingredients. I made cupcakes, and dropped about 1/2 tsp. raspberry jam in the center of the batter before baking.  I frosted them with pink buttercream frosting.  I tasted one before I frosted them to make an accurate judgment of their quality. Perfect.  Moist, yes moist! Tender, flavorful and pleasantly sweet.  The failure or success of this recipe is hugely dependent upon proper mixing technique and not overbaking!",

I don't know why many people said that their cake was dense and dry mine turned out fluffy and moist and yummy! This is a great recipe as long as you cream the butter til it's VERY fluffy and light as well as when you add the eggs. I added a touch more milk but other than that i followed the recipe exactly. It was great way better that a mix it's not as sugary and sticky. Thank you for this recipe it's delicious!",

We started this one off without changing the recipe and it came out nice.  Can't wait to start fiddling with it.\r\n\r\nIt's been a nearly a year and we've changed this up a few times for the better.  If you want to stick as close to the recipe try this variation out.  \r\n\r\nAdd 1 egg yolk, 1 teaspoon of butter flavoring and substitute half and half for the milk.\r\nIf you have a kithenaid mixer, break out the whip instead of the batter blade.  It produces a fluffier batter.  Mix it until it puffs up a bit and bake it for the 30-40 mins.  We used a 9x9 glass pan.  Now if you have gotten to the 40 min mark and the center is still a bit liquidy, turn the oven down to 250 and let it sit on the top shelf of oven for an addtional 10 mins.  It will set up well this way and you don't risk burning the edges of the cake.  \r\n\r\nThis cake was gone in 1 setting when my in laws dropped in.  We've also mixed strawberry jam into the butter/egg mixture and gotten great results and we've done a chocolate version by making the milk into a cocoa mixture.  Next up to try will be spumoni.  We love to experiment!",
