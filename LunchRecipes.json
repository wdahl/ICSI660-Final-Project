Well seeing as I really didn't have any army to feed and there's no way that 3 Tbsp. of mayo would make any sense I used only one can. I eyeballed the amount of chopped celery and left out the relish (personal preference). I added a little salt pepper garlic and onion powders. The addition of the hard boiled egg was a nice change.",

Instead of sweet relish I opted to add dill or sometimes my favorite dill pickels diced up and my other version...Giuliano jalapeno spread ( it's really a relish)! WOW. Or...chili flakes. Let the flavors mesh for several hours or overnight. I've served in a hollowed our red bell pepper. Even diced the tops into the salad. Great on crackers too. Toasted bread is a must! I don't use the egg but I do use Costco's Kirkland Albacore and chill the cans ahead. I keep all in the fridge for fast cool salads or sandwiches. Also another variation....diced cucumbers (persian) dried dill.....the sky is the limit. Even added tabasco at times or lemon juice. Have fun...let the family rate them or have several and give your guests rate them. I did this for an all day bbq as lunch snacks. SoCal so we try to make it healthy. I also use light Best Foods mayo. You can do all the above and also add small shell pasta. Enjoy",

I used part of a red onion, sliced into very thin rings, and added about half \nthe jalapeno, already diced in the can.\nI put all the extras between the 2 slices \nof cheese... seems the melted cheese helps hang on to the tomato, onion and pepper much better than putting it on top... and it's alot easier to flip that way, not to mention a bit less messy to eat. Butter is much better tasting on GC's, and I really wouldn't even TRY them with Margarine. Totally different taste, and the butter browns up so much nicer. I think I may have\n   found my new fave GC right here in this recipe! Next time I'll add a bit more jalapeno! \nThank you, PATELGURL... these GC's rock!",

              "reviewBody": "I have to admit I was a little skeptical of how the finished product would taste because of so few ingredients but it turned out great! The only issue I have is the stated amounts for the tomato sauce and the beans are a little odd. 2 cups of sauce is slightly more than what comes in a standard can of tomato sauce so I added in some water to make up the difference. My bigger issue was the 24 oz of prepared beans. A standard can of beans is 15oz and if you drain and rinse them they are about 8oz. So are we to measure 1.5 cans undrained? Or 3 cans drained? Since the recipe was a little vague I just threw in 2 cans of rinsed beans and that seemed to be a good consistency. Instead of using 1 tbsp of basil (because this seemed like a lot to me) I used 1 tsp. This was really tasty with freshly grated parmesan on top.",

I did make a few changes though: I added some mild italian sausage about halfway between adding the onion and adding the garlic. Some other people have said already another change I made which was adding a bit of water to the can of tomato sauce to get it to 2 cups. It doesn't mess with the flavor and it helps to thin the soup just a tad. Finally I used dried Herbs de Provence instead of the basil since it's a bit too strong for me and I just love Herbs de Provence.",

I love a good Cobb Salad, but I never much paid attention to what I know is a classic list of ingredients.  So glad to find this recipe here, and this is quite easily the best Cobb Salad I've ever had anywhere, probably because I controlled the ingredients, their quality and their freshness.  I stuck to the ingredients as written as, again, I recognize them to be critical to an authentic Cobb Salad.  I did, however, make my own Buttermilk Ranch Dressing.   This was an ideal dinner to make for myself since Hubs is out of town and he would have never eaten this in a million years - well, not with the Blue cheese anyway.  My tummy is happy.  (Tip: Penzey's Spices makes a seasoning blend called \"Buttermilk Dressing and Dip\" which makes a quick but awesome ranch dressing!  I don't even use buttermilk - just sour cream, mayo and half and half to desired thickness)",

However, who cares if it's not the \"original\" recipe; if it tastes good, eat it! I prefer a mixture of romaine and butter lettuce with a dressing consisting of red wine vinegar, olive oil (which I drizzle in slowly to emulsify) dijon mustard, chopped fresh chives and crumbled blue cheese. Any way you decide to make this salad with whatever dressing, it will always be a hit. Thanks so much Mr. Bill!",

Adding additional ingredients could make this a much better a more solid Banh Mi. One key ingredient that was not mentioned here is the soy sauce which is typically added atop the mayo and for those feeling a bit more adventurous, duck/chicken pate. As far as meat goes, the most popular/common filling is the cha siu (xa xiu) pork which is a sweet BBQ pork that is grilled/fried (my personal favorite as it goes well with the pickled veggies). Chicken can be used as well, Vietnamese  cold cuts, pork meatballs or even firm fried tofu for a vegetarian option.",

I'd had pork to use from a slow smoked butt roast which was moist & wonderfully seasoned so I think any good flavored pork or chicken might work just as well. I let the veggies marinate 1 hour & they were great - lots of flavor but still fresh & crunchy! I lightly toasted just the crusts of my bagette, & I used all the veg & garnish suggested but added a dash of soy sauce over all because the mayo just didn't do enough, so I'll hafta figure that out next. But try it - it's a great sandwich!",

So I can't attest to whether or not it is authentic but I will say I followed this recipe pretty closely and it was delicious and very fresh. The only changes I made were I used a whole grain hoagie roll instead of a French baguette and I mixed in Sriracha with my mayonnaise. My husband thoroughly enjoyed it and we plan on making more meat tomorrow to eat with the left over veggies I prepared. I'm letting the slaw marinate overnight as well and expect it to be even more fantastic tomorrow. Definitely would recommend trying.",

Since I didn't have any cashews on hand I added some chopped apple. This was perfect on toasted whole grain bread and didn't require any extra mayo or tomato just some crisp lettuce - YUM!",

Tonight I warmed some Turkish flatbread in the oven, spread the chickpea filling on it generously, threw some halved cherry tomatoes and thin slices of cucumber on and drizzled with a bit of light yoghurt. Then wrapped it all up burrito-style. After the first bite I thought it was a nice 4 star spread, but it kept tasting better and better with each bite. Now I am finding it hard no to attack the leftovers with a spoon and eat up the whole lot. So good. Wonderful texture, the dill works great (esecially with the salad and yoghurt) and its so healthy. Fingerlicking good. Thanks.",

I make mine in the food processor and always add a dash of Tabasco to it. We've also made it with Dijon mustard replacing the lemon juice... very versatile and yummy recipe!",

              "reviewBody": "WOW!!!  This was fantastic!!!  I am so glad I finally tried this recipe, because it was perfect for a light summer dinner.  I omitted the celery (personal preference) and used less onions.  I used fat free mayo, no sugar added relish, and the dill weed and lemon were perfect!!  mashing the chickpeas took some time (I tried using a mixer... not the best idea.  There were chickpeas firing everywhere!) but it was all well worth it!  \n\nWe used it to fill pitas, along with romaine and tomato slices.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!!  With 3 vegetarians and 3 non-veg, we all agreeded it was simply amazing!!!  My Grandmother didn't even realize it wasn't tuna!",

I put some of the extra meat in the fridge for later and still had a lot of leftover meat.  I filled my muffin pan with scoops of meat.  Each individual muffin tin holds the same as a typical sandwich.  I put the muffin tin in the freezer and froze the individual serving size leftovers.  After about 2 hours I took the tin out removed the meat  muffins.  Next they went into a ziploc and they will not all stick together.  To reheat just pop one in the microwave on 50% power.  These are great for a quick sandwich, with rice, with beans, or with eggs.",

              "reviewBody": "Absolutely delicious!!! I would give this one 10 stars! I cooked on low for 10 hours, then shredded and kept it on warm for a couple more hours. I am seriously keeping this recipe forever. This is the perfect weekend bbq/potluck food, and went great with grilled corn on the cob and red potato salad. Also, when you shred the meat you can remove most of the fat. I think you could do without the oil. I used kraft honey bbq sauce - just what I had on hand. SOOOO tasty. You can't stop eating this.

It turned out much more moist than the root beer recipe I tried earlier. I did serve BBQ on the side, but I'm not sure it needed it.",

              "reviewBody": "I love this recipe! I've made it several times and everyone always goes crazy for it. I use a 6-7 lb. bone-in shoulder. I've used a deboned and a bone-in and the bone-in definitely comes out a little tastier. I leave out the oil and the chicken broth, because I think the broth makes it too juicy and I just don't think the oil is necessary. Instead, I just put in the entire bottle of barbeque sauce. I use like 10 cloves of garlic and a huge vidalia onion. You don't have to bother chopping up the onions or garlic too small because by the time it's done, they're all dissolved. I put in closer to 1/2 cup brown sugar, 8 or so drops of Liquid Smoke, two tablespoons of chili powder and a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon. In my opinion, and I think everyone I've fed this to would agree, the cinnamon is KEY. It makes it SO GOOD and adds such a depth of flavor. The recipe doesn't mention this, but make sure you put the roast in the slow cooker fat side up so it can drip down into the meat while it cooks. I cook it on low overnight for about 12 hours, then pull it and remove all the fat, strain the liquid and add it all back to the cooker for another 4 hours or so. The leftovers really do taste better every day. Make sure to make a semi-sweet southern slaw to go along with it - HEAVEN!  ;)",

              "reviewBody": "Made this with a 6 lb. pork loin roast I had bought on reduced for quick sale. I followed the ingredients increased for my size of roast, except for using dry mustard in lieu of prepared and adding liquid smoke. I cooked on high two hours and then low for seven. I took the meat out and it shredded with complete ease two hours before serving, then placed back in the crockpot. There was alot of liquid and needed to reduce a good two cups worth after placing the shredded meat back in the crockpot. Added a bit of BBQ sauce and liquid smoke at that point to give the meat a bit more flavor, even though it was tender, still lacked that BBQ flavor. After another two hours this was the best tasting pork I've evern made in the slow cooker. Our guest even requested to take home some for lunch the next day. I'm not sure I'd add the broth next time, I feel the fat in the meat made plenty of juice.  *Note when placing meat in crockpot, always leave the fat side on top so the juices sink down into the meat while cooking...read that somewhere.",

Although it was very easy to get together and the pork turned out perfectly and just fell apart, the taste just wasn't doing it for me. It was way too sweet for me, I was hoping for more of that smoky flavor. If I make this again I won't be adding any sugar, maybe more vinegar and maybe some liquid smoke to give it that pulled pork flavor.",

I just added some finely diced celery for crunch, 1 tsp dill weed (gotta have dill in your egg salad sandwich), 1/2 tsp onion powder instead of the green onions (didnt have any on hand) and used dijon mustard for a little more flavor.  Turned out great, I ate half of it before it even made it to the fridge for lunch the next day.",

It IS delicious, taking me back to earlier days and a simpler style of cooking. (For me that would mean waaaay back in the day :)  I mean, didn't everyone's mom make egg salad just like this?  This is good just as is, but you can doll it up any way you like.  For me, that meant adding celery, because for us it just isn't egg salad without it.  But in the end, this is an egg salad recipe for what it is -  a good, basic, classic, egg salad, and not for all the fussier things it isn't.",

Took just minutes to chop up all the eggs!\n\nFor perfect hard-cooked eggs, the Broiler & Egg Association of Minnesota says to place eggs in single layer in covered saucepan in cold water, bring to boil, remove from heat and let stand for 15 minutes.  Once the time has elapsed, place eggs in ice water until cool.  This works beautifully - the eggs are done to perfection, there's no green edges, and they peeled quite easily, no tearing!",

I buttered rye bread slices on one side and spread Thousand Island dressing on the other side.  On the dressing side I placed a slice of swiss cheese, sliced  Pastrami from the deli and then topped with sourkraut.  I cooked them on my George Foreman grill until the cheese was melted and the bread was nice and toasted.  They were delicious!  I only gave the four star rating because the sourkraut in the middle wasn't very warm.  Next time I make these I will warm the sourkraut in the microwave first and maybe add another slice of swiss too!  If you like Rueben sandwiches you will love this one!",

Maybe 5 at most from start to finish. If this recipe works for you, then good. However, we do it quite differently. We start off by putting approximately 1/4 cup sauerkraut (we never measure it, we just grab some) on the grill, and a bag of about the same amount of chip corn beef on top of that. Then we put two pieces of bread down with some butter, and put two pieces of swiss cheese on each piece of bread. Once the sauerkraut and beef has heated up for a minute or two, we put it on one piece of bread, and put the 1000 island dressing on the other piece. As I said before, it shouldn't take more than 5-10 minutes to make.",
