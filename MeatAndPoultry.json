In order to make it sheet-pan friendly, the chicken is not breaded or fried. Add as much of the delicious sauce as you like, and if there is any left, store the sauce in the fridge in a sealed container, up to one week. It's also a great dipping sauce for Asian-style appetizers. Serve over hot steamed rice.",

As I was mixing together the spice blend, I was thinking it was making an awful lot and that there was a ton of salt since lemon pepper seasoning is already salty as is...but I went with it.  On the two chicken breasts, I only used 1/4 of the seasoning I had mixed up because there was so much of it, and it still came out too salty.  The amount of seasoning as written would be enough for about 8 breasts.  I highly recommend you only make a half batch at most, and leave out the salt - only sprinkle some on at the end if needed.  I used 8oz breasts and they were done at 10 minutes. The onions were starting to burn, so keep an eye on things. I do like broiling chicken though, as they tend to come out juicy (assuming you don't overcook them!).",

I did brown the outsides of the tenderloin on the saute setting with olive oil in the IP before pressure cooking. I will definitely be making this again!

Served it with Paula Deens Cottage Potato's and steamed vegetables. No complaints from the boys who were over for dinner.   Went down well with a 2004 Pinot Noir. Will make this again.",

I compiled and followed all of the advice of previous reviewers: \n \n-I lightly browned the onions in butter before adding.  \n-I also added chopped green onions, mushrooms, and a green bell pepper. \n-I used italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  \n-I tripled the sauce (many said that there was not enough sauce/topping) and \n-I baked for longer than the recipe states (I baked for a total of one hour and 25 minutes).  \n\nIt came out perfectly.

I chose this recipe based on the high marks and the easy ingredients.  I substituted ground turkey for the beef, and followed the \"most helpful\" suggestions of sauteeing the onions in butter + garlic, and adding 1 Tbsp. of worchestshire to the meat mix.  Other than that, followed the recipe completely, and it was wonderful!!!  Very tasty and moist (one thing I can't stand is a dry meatloaf, not this one!) and I have a feeling it will make great meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow.  Thanks for the post!",

A 1.30# of meat cooked in an hour.  This turned out great and we went back for seconds even when my man is sick and said he wasn't hungry!  I personally thought the topping was a tad too sweet so I would do everything the same next time except reduce the brown sugar some.  This was very easy and a big hit.

              "reviewBody": "Hands down, this was the best meatloaf that I've ever made.  I used about 2.3 lbs. of ground beef.  \n\nFollowing some of the advice of others as well as adding a few of my own tweaks, the meatloaf was perfect.  \n\nHere's what I did:\n\n1.  I sautéed finely chopped onion, 3 cloves (minced garlic) & 2 stalks of celery in butter (which really makes the loaf tender); then added it to the ground beef.\n\n2.  I added 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce to the ground beef mixture along with 2 eggs instead of 1, 1 1/4 cup of milk & about 1 1/2 cup of dried Italian bread crumbs.\n\n3.  For the sauce:  I initially made it as the directions indicated with 2 TBSP. of brown sugar, and found it to be way too sweet.  I then added 1/3 more ketchup and a couple of dashes of Worcestershire Sauce and it was perfect.\n\n4.  It was an abundance of sauce, and a lot of the other reviews said that there wasn't enough sauce, so I spooned a thin layer at the bottom of the loaf, molded half the loaf, then sauced the top, and then added the rest of the loaf on top and sauced it really well.  This was absolutely perfect.  \n\n5.  Lastly, there was no specification on whether or not to cook the meatloaf covered or uncovered.  I used enough aluminum foil to line the baking dish as well as cover the top (so I essentially wrapped the loaf in foil) and cooked covered for 45 minutes, drained most of any accumulated liquid and cooked uncovered for an additional 30 minutes.\n\nThis was super moist and delicious!!!!!",

It cooks down and is sooo aromatic.  The mix of sausage and beef is sublime, so no need for more salt.  I always add a dash of nutmeg to the ricotta mixture (an old italian secret!).  I usually make this a day ahead for the flavors and herbs to meld in the fridge then let it sit at room temperature for about 1 hour before baking. Have made for company too, and always get RAVES on it's authenticity.  Great, winter comfort food and feeds a lot of people.  Another tip for lasagna makers - no need to wash another pot to boil noodles.  Soak raw, hard noodles in a large bowl of very hot tap water for 20-30 min.  Noodles won't be cooked but soft, and can complete it's cooking in the oven.  I learned this from a caterer - try it!",

              "reviewBody": "I made this recipe using some tips and tricks from previous reviewers and from my experience having worked in an italian restaurant.  This recipe does not have to be as time intensive as is recommended in the instructions.  As another reviewer noted, it is not necessary to cook the noodles--just soak them in hot water while you are cooking the rest of the ingredients.  You also do not need to cook the sauce.  Sounds bizarre, but it's true.  If you make the lasagna ahead and leave it in the fridge overnight, the flavors blend perfectly, no cooking required.  For a chunkier tomato sauce, I subbed 1/2 of the crushed tomatoes with diced italian-flavored tomatoes.  I layered everything in this order: sauce-noodles-ricotta mixture-sauce-meat-shredded mozzerella...i did 3 layers like this and then finished with a layer of noodles, sauce and shredded mozzerella and a generous sprinkling of parmesean on top.  Following this method, I had the whole thing put together and in the fridge in less than an hour.  It sat overnight and my husband had it in the oven when I got home from work.  Fantastic recipe!",

From reading all the reviews, I made these changes: Added an additional 1/2 pound of ground meat, omitted the salt, doubled the onions, all the spices, the parsley, canned tomatoes, paste, and sauce. I also doubled the filling ingredients and made three layers instead of two. Everyone raved about the lasagna and I have sauce left over for another use. \r\nSIDE NOTE: For anyone who thinks they don't like ricotta cheese: Buy it at an Italian market. Brands such as Sierra or Polly-O. There is no comparison to the taste or texture of supermarket brands. I think that's why I see recipes with regular cottage cheese instead of riccota. I don't use supermarket riccota under any circumstances, it's just plain nasty!",

I make it pretty much as shown, except if I have the time, I let the sauce simmer on the stove as long as possible. I also add a bit of whatever red wine I have on hand to the sauce. And I try to make a double recipe, so I can use the sauce for other things - it works wonderfully for Chicken Parmesan, plain ol' spaghetti, and anywhere else you'd use a red sauce.\r\n\r\nEverything tastes better the second day, too. Oh, one more thing - I never boil my noodles. I simply buy regular dried noodles, and make sure I have plenty of sauce in the lasagna. It cooks long enough that the noodles boil in the oven, and you end up with a lasagna that isn't runny and holds its shape well.",

I read the reviews about omitting the fennel and I have to disagree. I believe the fennel is one of the ingredients that makes this dish outstanding. I made the sauce the day before and simmered for 6 hours. Sounds like a lot of work but come on! How hard is it to check a pot simmering??! I had enough sauce for 2 pans of lasagna so that's what I did. Made 2 baked one and froze the other. I just finally made my frozen one yesterday. I allowed it to thaw in the fridge overnight and then baked as directed. Just as delicious as the first batch!!! My hubby is a lasagna snob and says this is the best lasagna recipe ever.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I only used 1/3 of the salt called for. (One serving of the original recipe is almost a full daily allowance of sodium.) It was still too salty. It tasted like something you'd buy in the freezer section at the grocery store. Why waste all that time making it at home if it doesn't taste any better than the manufactured stuff and isn't any healthier? There also seemed to be too much sauce and not enough of the ricotta mixture or mozzarella. Suggestions: 1. Leave out the added salt altogether. There's already enough salt in the sausage, parmesan and canned tomato products to season everything. 2. Drain the meat after browning and before adding anything else. All that saturated fat does nothing to improve the flavor. 3. Use oregano instead of Italian seasoning and leave out the fennel. Italian sausage already has fennel in it. 4. Leave out one of the cans of tomato paste. The condensed tomato flavor was so strong it drowned out the spices. 5. Use a full 16-oz block of mozzarella, and grate it instead of slicing it. You'll get more even coverage. 6. Double the ricotta mixture (ricotta, egg, parsley). 7. (Optional) Replace the 1/2 cup of water with 1/2 cup of red wine, preferably chianti or cabernet sauvignon.",

I would personally give it 4 stars.  It was a bit too meaty for me and there didn't seem to be enough ricotta (but I know a lot of peopele don't like ricotta anyways).  I followed a couple reviewer's suggestions and soaked the noodles in a large roasting pan (try it -there is plenty of room to allow the noodles to lay flat) in VERY hot tap water for about 30 minutes. I added the browned meat / garlic / onion mixture to the tomatoes, paste, sauce, seasonings, etc. WITHOUT simmering.  I assembled the lasagna the evening before (sauce, 6 noodles, ricotta, mozzarella slices, sauce, Parmesan, exact same layer again and sprinkled with shredded mozzarella and rest of Parm).  I purchased a 1 lb. package of sliced mozzarella and ended up using all of it (and it turned out fine).  Also purchased mild Italian sausage (not the sweet stuff - couldn't find it).  Be sure to use fresh parsley.  It gives the dish nice color and adds a fresh taste that you won't get from the dried stuff.  Also, be sure to add fennel seed.  It really adds  nice flavor to the dish.  Leftovers were yummy.  I took some to my parents, and my mom had one square.  My dad ate the other 4!  This one's a keeper, and is worthy of all stars because of the compliments - and shortcuts.  Try them, they REALLY, REALLY work!.  Thanks!",

I also seasoned the cracker crumbs with minced garlic and sea salt.  The chicken turned out great.  I will definitely make this recipe again.",

I dipped the boneless, skinless chicken breasts into the butter and then into the crumbs. I baked at the recommended temp for 50 minutes then checked the internal temp. 160F!! Pulled them out and...

I put some of the extra meat in the fridge for later and still had a lot of leftover meat.  I filled my muffin pan with scoops of meat.  Each individual muffin tin holds the same as a typical sandwich.  I put the muffin tin in the freezer and froze the individual serving size leftovers.  After about 2 hours I took the tin out removed the meat  muffins.  Next they went into a ziploc and they will not all stick together.  To reheat just pop one in the microwave on 50% power.  These are great for a quick sandwich, with rice, with beans, or with eggs.",

I am seriously keeping this recipe forever. This is the perfect weekend bbq/potluck food, and went great with grilled corn on the cob and red potato salad. Also, when you shred the meat you can remove most of the fat. I think you could do without the oil. I used kraft honey bbq sauce - just what I had on hand. SOOOO tasty. You can't stop eating this.

              "reviewBody": "I love this recipe! I've made it several times and everyone always goes crazy for it. I use a 6-7 lb. bone-in shoulder. I've used a deboned and a bone-in and the bone-in definitely comes out a little tastier. I leave out the oil and the chicken broth, because I think the broth makes it too juicy and I just don't think the oil is necessary. Instead, I just put in the entire bottle of barbeque sauce. I use like 10 cloves of garlic and a huge vidalia onion. You don't have to bother chopping up the onions or garlic too small because by the time it's done, they're all dissolved. I put in closer to 1/2 cup brown sugar, 8 or so drops of Liquid Smoke, two tablespoons of chili powder and a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon. In my opinion, and I think everyone I've fed this to would agree, the cinnamon is KEY. It makes it SO GOOD and adds such a depth of flavor. The recipe doesn't mention this, but make sure you put the roast in the slow cooker fat side up so it can drip down into the meat while it cooks. I cook it on low overnight for about 12 hours, then pull it and remove all the fat, strain the liquid and add it all back to the cooker for another 4 hours or so. The leftovers really do taste better every day. Make sure to make a semi-sweet southern slaw to go along with it - HEAVEN!  ;)",

I followed the ingredients increased for my size of roast, except for using dry mustard in lieu of prepared and adding liquid smoke. I cooked on high two hours and then low for seven. I took the meat out and it shredded with complete ease two hours before serving, then placed back in the crockpot. There was alot of liquid and needed to reduce a good two cups worth after placing the shredded meat back in the crockpot. Added a bit of BBQ sauce and liquid smoke at that point to give the meat a bit more flavor, even though it was tender, still lacked that BBQ flavor. After another two hours this was the best tasting pork I've evern made in the slow cooker. Our guest even requested to take home some for lunch the next day. I'm not sure I'd add the broth next time, I feel the fat in the meat made plenty of juice.  *Note when placing meat in crockpot, always leave the fat side on top so the juices sink down into the meat while cooking...read that somewhere.",

Although it was very easy to get together and the pork turned out perfectly and just fell apart, the taste just wasn't doing it for me. It was way too sweet for me, I was hoping for more of that smoky flavor. If I make this again I won't be adding any sugar, maybe more vinegar and maybe some liquid smoke to give it that pulled pork flavor.",

Oven cooking gives it more of a \"candied\" apperarance, whereas the crock-pot version is more watery.  If you want to try it the oven way, just well-grease a 13 X 9 dish and bake at 350 for 90 minutes, stirring after every 30 minutes (or until it's as done as your family likes it. My husband prefers it a little dark.)  Don't be afraid to try this recipe; it's really easy and nearly everyone who tastes it, just loves it!   Good Luck!",

When I made it again last night, I cut the brown sugar down by at least half, increased the horseradish by 75% or so, and added Dijon mustard, barbecue sauce, Worchestire sauce, and a taste of tabasco sauce.  Mmmmmm, yummy!  It's delicious!  My coworkers all want the recipe.  I think another key is to make sure your kielbasa slices are nice and thin.  I didn't enjoy it as much the first time I made it when I sliced the sausage too thickly.",

Being a Polish girl, I never had kielbasa this way! lol  I read the reviews and grilled my kielbasa lightly on the BBQ so that fat would not drip into the crockpot.  (I love my kielbasa BBQ'd).  Then to my dismay, I discovered that my husband used the last of our horseradish!  I didn't want to substitute but I had to use horshradish sauce. Luckily, some other reviewers had done the same and said it turned out great.  Well, I have to agree.  The sauce was NOT liquidly or runny from too much fat...the horseradish sauce still gave it a nice zing without too much heat (even my six year old son loved it).  Just a delicious way to prepare kielbasa.  We always grill kielbasa for appetitizers at parties and I was thinking of even making the sauce and serving it on the side for dipping.  The combination of the smoked, garlicky kielbasa and the sweet/tangy sauce is sooooooooooooo good!  Thanks for a great recipe.",

I read all the previous reviews and decided to make the following adjustments - used only 2/3 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup BBQ sauce sprinkle of dried mustard a few shakes of Worchestershire sauce and as directed 1/4 cup of horseradish. Yes you must slice the sausage very thin for the best results. I cooked on low for about 2 1/2 hours and it was wonderful. If I took this recipe to a pitch-in I would at least double it and probably triple it.",

I love tamarind and this was the only recipe with tamarind in it. \nI think I'll try to make noodles a little different and pour hot water over them, since I like my noodles very soft. I made a bigger amount of food and my noodles were not exactly perfect and it took a bit longer. Overall, great recipe, thank you. I'll be making it over and over again.",

No chicken (I’m plant based), only used 8 oz of noodles so I would have higher vegetable to noodle ratio, and only 2 tbs of sugar because I don’t like an overly sweet pad thai. I added carrot matchsticks & thinly sliced onion as well for more vegetables. I also used tamarind concentrate (not paste, I find it very difficult to work with). I was able to find brown rice noodles which were also delicious & no change in texture or taste.",

Also, I didn't actually measure the amount of cheese I used. As they say, \"You measure that sh!t with your heart.\" :)\n\nThings I'd do differently next time: for the egg mixture, start with the sour cream and add the milk a little bit at a time to keep it from getting lumpy, and then whisk in the eggs and salt/spices. Otherwise, this was PERFECT.",

So I doubled the sauce, used a deep dish pie plate, reduced the temp to 375 & baked for 45 minutes. It was perfectly moist without being runny, and the pie shells were perfectly done. Absolutely fabulous! Goes without saying it is a keeper!",

The first being I added more seasoning (garlic pepper, garlic powder, poultry seasoning) to the sauce and to the chicken mixture before cooking. Also, I cooked the chicken and veggies in chicken stock instead of water. My husband doesn't like celery so I used potato instead and also added some corn. I used Pillsbury ready made pie crusts (so easy..just open and unroll). And after brushing with egg white, baked the bottom crust for 5 minutes. I doubled the sauce and added most to the chicken mixture before putting it into the pan.  I baked on 375 for 40 minutes. It looked and tasted delicious!!",

I took a lot of the previous suggestions, and I boiled my veggies in chicken broth (just added a boullion cube) although I didn't use peas (can't stand them) and just boneless, skinless breast meat. I used 3/4 cup of onion, and subbed 1/2 tsp garlic powder for celery seed (didn't have any).  I drained the broth from the veggies, and used 2 cups in the pan, and after I added everything into the crust, I poured about another 1/4 cup of broth in with everything (as other reviewers complained it was too dry).  Cooked for 30 min in a gas oven, and it came out perfect! Will definitely make again.\n\nedited to add: I also made this with 3 small, cubed potatoes, and it made it even better.",

Took the advice of others and used a rotisserie chicken, added poultry seasoning and garlic powder, etc. Also used frozen deep dish pie shells. Next time I will mix the filling and gravy together before putting it in the shell. I couldn't get the liquid to seep down through which caused the filling to be a bit too dry. I also think it needed a little bit more salt so will use garlic salt rather than powder next time. It was still pretty good considering my distaste for \"pot pies\". Definitely think mixing the filling with the liquid is the answer.  Update:  made this again but used frozen mixed veggies in addition to a cubed potato and the onion. Made extra gravy (about 1/2 more) and mixed with the filling before putting in the pie shell. Really helped the dryness.   Yet another update: Made this again using phyllo puff pastry in ramekins and wow is it good! Perfect size for the grand kids who loved it!  We also froze some and took to work for lunch - takes about 5-7 minutes in the microwave! Note:  I always have L.B. Jamison's chicken soup base on hand and add a spoonful to chicken & noodles, chicken soup, this recipe and others.  Really brings out the flavor!",

When the chicken was done I saute'd it in butter with garlic, onions, salt and pepper. I also added a can of cream of chicken soup because I needed more gravy. There was so much meat and veggies that I put it in a 9x13 pan and topped it with two pilsbury already made dough. I brushed the top of the dough with egg white and it came out so wonderful! What a recipe. I will be making this again and again.\n\nUpdate - I made this with left over roast from last nights meal and it was amazing. I used beef broth and also a jar of beef gravy so we'd have extra. My kids liked it better then the chicken pot pie.",

I boil these in broth with the chicken, 4) After the sauce has thickened, I dump the chicken and veggies (after draining) into the saucepan and stir it all together before putting it in my pie.\n\nDoubling the sauce and adding extra veggies gives me a little leftover filling when I do a regular deep dish pie (I'm ok with this though, as I happily eat the filling on its own). However, usually I make 2 dozen mini pies in my muffin tin, cooking for 20 minutes. I love these mini pies because I'm constantly on the run and can eat them with one hand without a fork and knife!",

Turkey can be a bit dry, so I will say you need more seasoning than listed. I added garlic and onion powder, onions, chicken stock, a little salt and pepper.  I used 2 pounds of turkey instead of one because turkey shrivels up a lot. Extremely easy and quick to make. Thanks so much for the newly added recipe!",
